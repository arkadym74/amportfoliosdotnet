<p style="font-size: 95%; font-family: Arial;"><b><i>As modern technology progresses, we as users require more GUI based applications. Web designers build visually stunning websites, programmers, software and application developers are trying to accommodate users with requirements for modern looking software that use visual representation. UI/ UX Developers and Designers are the one who truly know what type of experience users prefer. This page holds a collection of my own projects that are using such languages as Java, C#, C++, MySQL examples, some web technologies such as CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, ASP.NET, PHP, Python, some of the projects will be GUI based some text based, but I will try to keep my visitors interested. In the coming months I will add more projects as they become available. People can use them as open source. I will also add some manuals, and compressed files which contain source code or fully working application. If anyone has questions about the content of this page please feel free to contact me on my contact page.</i></b></p>

<h2 style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Brief Description of a Project</h2>
</div>

<div class="mobile_par">
<p style="font-size: 95%; font-family: Arial;"><b><i>Created using NetBeans IDE 8.2 application, programming language Java. It has three classes, main class, business class, database class. Main class has all the GUI and controls, business class contains business logic, constructors, methods and functions that are called from the main class, database class has all the database connectivity, retrieval and data entry functionality. It is a complete product, that needs some tweaking of some parts of a product, and it could also be a work in progress to add more functionality or build entirely different product based on the same code. It has a lot of possibilities to play with already written code. I have created that code when I was given an option to create a project for my Java class, based on some specific parameters and it was a success. I have also created a manual based on that product, and as I have already mentioned before, it is an open source and anyone could use it either to play with the code to add more functionality to it, or use it in their own project. I have used MySQL database to write to and to retrieve from inside an application, but any database could be used when products code is tweaked to use specific database. A database is a very important part of this product, as most parts used with database to retrieve customer order information in order to view it as a record or to print out a receipt.</i></b></p>

<div class="mobile_par">
<p style="font-size: 95%; font-family: Arial;"><b><i>A grade calculator is one of small projects written in C# that is showing my skills using Microsoft Visual Studio. There is no manual for it, but as a previous project is could be downloaded from this site. The way it works a teacher enters a student&#39;s full name, a score grade based on a score from 0 to 1000, and it calculates a student&#39;s grade % and a gives a letter grade. An images will follow as before. The project is completely text based, it has no GUI and this is why it is very small and portable in size. The capability of C# as a programming language is unparalleled, it has capability to create GUI interfaces as well, but for this kind of project a GUI is irrelevant. </i></b></p>
